This project was primarily driven by my interest in the possibilities offered by web-based virtual reality. All demos were built in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and are intended to be viewed on a Google Cardboard Headset.

A large amount of time was spent on testing different aspects of VR, such as sound, interaction and movement in isolation before combining these elements to a final piece.

As VR technology becomes more advanced and daily interactions move into virtual spaces, the line between reality and simulation will inevetably be blurred. On a purely physiological level, this is already the case: Studies have shown that VR experiences provoke the same physical reactions as real-world experiences.

My final piece deals with the tension between reality and simulation by putting the user in a series of spaces nested within one another. The title is derived from the [1935 short story](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22893/22893-h/22893-h.htm) by Stanley G. Weinbaum, which is regarded as one of the earliest works dealing with the modern notion of virtual reality.

## Notes on viewing VR work

The piece will run on most modern smartphones and computers, however performance might suffer on lower-end devices.

- Navigate to [http://www.maxkoehler.com/vr-lab/app/](http://www.maxkoehler.com/vr-lab/app/) in Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS).
- Select a scene
- Tap "Enter VR" button in the lower-right corner of the screen.
- Insert phone into Cardboard headset, make sure it sits in the center.
- It is recommended to use headphones.

Alternatively, all work can be viewed on any laptop or computer with a modern browser.
